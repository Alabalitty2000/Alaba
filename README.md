# 🚀 Frontend Wizards — Stage 0: Testable Profile Card

## 📖 Project Description
This project is a **Testable, Accessible, and Responsive Profile Card** built for **Frontend Wizards Stage 0** using **semantic HTML**, **modern CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.

The profile card displays:
- A user avatar image  
- User’s name and short biography  
- Current time in milliseconds (updated dynamically)  
- Social media links  
- Lists of hobbies and dislikes  

All visible elements include specific `data-testid` attributes for automated testing, ensuring semantic correctness and accessibility.
